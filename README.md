Right from enjoying so much of popularity on the campus in terms of attracting new blood every year to the widespread fame gained in terms of plethora of novelty in both – its signature events and newly introduced ones, ISTE-ITNU has all of it! The boldness of the club is also apparent in the challenges it has taken into hands.

Another feather in the cap of ISTE was the successful and satisfactory completion of IFEST 13’ with around 4000 participants from all over the place thronging the campus.

Also, ISTE was the pioneer club, which organized the 1st ever technical night in Gujarat in the form of a wonderful 3-D Mapping show!!
